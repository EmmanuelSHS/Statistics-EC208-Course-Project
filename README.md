This contains the code for my course project for EC208.

This course project was finished on June 2014. This repository was later upgraded version with scripts in a neaty manner.

There are two R scripts for this course project.

The first is DataCleaning.R, which contains the code for processing the raw data into the neat type needed for further analysis.

The second is AnalysisMainScipt.R, which includes all the code for Regression Analysis and ANOVA. Detailed explaination included inside the script.
